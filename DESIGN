Design of Bakge

Bakge builds as a static library, making it much easier to run various tests
without having to constantly modify the main function.

Currently Bakge will use GLFW as its media library. This could change in
the future if working with X-windows or Windows API interests anyone.

Here are some links to design documents that you can read up on to learn
about Bakge and the design.
