Bakge
=====

CSUB Summer project game engine. A collaborative effort between CS students at California State University, Bakersfield. But even if you don't attend CSUB, feel free to contribute. The project is more about collaboration than it is about the engine.

Bakge builds as a static library. Unit testing is done in the test/ directory. Bakge's repo is very friendly, with lots of guidelines and tips on how you can contribute. Feel free to message a contributor if you have any questions about getting started.


How to help
===========

Check out the guidelines here: http://github.com/palistov/bakge/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE The process might seem confusing and unnecessarily complex, but it helps changes be discussed and tested openly before being finalized.
